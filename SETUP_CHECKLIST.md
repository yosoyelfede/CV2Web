## üîÑ Current Status

**Phase 1: Backend Foundation** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

The application is now ready for testing with the following capabilities:
- User authentication
- CV file upload (TXT format)
- AI-powered CV parsing with Claude
- Structured data extraction
- Database storage and retrieval
- Processing job tracking

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application:**
   - URL: http://localhost:3001
   - Create an account or sign in

3. **Test CV upload:**
   - Create a simple TXT file with CV content
   - Upload it through the dashboard
   - Check the processing status
   - Verify extracted data

4. **Check database:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor
   - Verify data is being stored in cv_documents and cv_data tables

## üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 2)
